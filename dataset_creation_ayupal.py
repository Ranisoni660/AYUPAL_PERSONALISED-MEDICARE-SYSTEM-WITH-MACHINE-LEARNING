disease_descriptions = {
    'Fungal infection': 'A fungal infection, also called mycosis, is a disease caused by a fungus. Common fungal infections include athlete\'s foot, jock itch, ringworm, and yeast infections. These infections can affect the skin, nails, or lungs and can be itchy and uncomfortable.',
    'Allergy': 'An allergy is a condition in which the immune system reacts abnormally to a foreign substance. These substances, such as pollen, dust, and certain foods, are usually harmless to most people. Symptoms can include sneezing, itching, and swelling.',
    'GERD': 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a long-term digestive disorder where stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). This backwash (acid reflux) can irritate the lining of your esophagus and cause heartburn.',
    'Chronic cholestasis': 'Chronic cholestasis is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is reduced or blocked for an extended period. Bile is a digestive fluid that helps break down fats. When its flow is disrupted, it can lead to jaundice, itching, and liver damage.',
    'Drug Reaction': 'A drug reaction is an unwanted effect caused by the administration of drugs. This can range from mild side effects like nausea to severe allergic reactions such as rashes, swelling, or even anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening condition.',
    'Peptic ulcer disease': 'Peptic ulcer disease involves the development of open sores that form on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper part of your small intestine. The most common symptom is stomach pain. These ulcers can be caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).',
    'AIDS': 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body\'s ability to fight infection and disease. It is spread through contact with infected blood, semen, or vaginal fluids.',
    'Diabetes': 'Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, nerve damage, eye problems, and kidney disease. There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2.',
    'Gastroenteritis': 'Gastroenteritis, often called stomach flu, is an inflammation of the lining of the intestines caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasites. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water.',
    'Bronchial Asthma': 'Bronchial asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Asthma can be triggered by allergens, exercise, cold air, or stress.',
    'Hypertension': 'Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the force of the blood against your artery walls is too high. Over time, high blood pressure can cause health problems, such as heart disease and stroke. It is often called the "silent killer" because it may not show symptoms for many years.',
    'Migraine': 'A migraine is a type of headache characterized by intense throbbing or pulsing pain in one area of the head. It is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Some people experience warning symptoms known as aura before the headache.',
    'Cervical spondylosis': 'Cervical spondylosis is age-related wear and tear affecting the spinal disks in your neck. It is a common condition that progresses with age, and it can cause chronic neck pain and stiffness. In severe cases, it can compress the spinal cord or nerve roots, leading to weakness in the arms and hands.',
    'Paralysis (brain hemorrhage)': 'Paralysis due to brain hemorrhage occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing bleeding inside the brain. This can disrupt normal brain function and result in the loss of muscle function in part of your body. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention.',
    'Jaundice': 'Jaundice is a condition in which the skin, whites of the eyes, and mucous membranes turn yellow because of a high level of bilirubin, a yellow-orange bile pigment. It is often a sign of liver disease or bile duct problems. Other symptoms may include dark urine and pale stools.',
    'Malaria': 'Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that infects a type of mosquito which feeds on humans. The disease is transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes and causes symptoms such as fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Without treatment, it can lead to severe complications and death.',
    'Chicken pox': 'Chicken pox is a highly contagious viral infection that causes an itchy, blister-like rash on the skin. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Most cases occur in children, but adults can get it as well. Vaccination can prevent chicken pox.',

    'Hepatitis B': 'Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be chronic and lead to long-term liver disease, liver cancer, or liver failure. It spreads through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, and vaginal fluids.',
    'Hepatitis C': 'Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is primarily spread through contact with blood from an infected person. Many people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms for many years, but it can lead to liver damage over time.',
    'Hepatitis D': 'Hepatitis D is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). It only occurs in people who are already infected with hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis D can cause more severe liver disease than hepatitis B alone.',
    'Hepatitis E': 'Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). It is primarily transmitted through consuming contaminated water. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, and nausea. It is usually self-limiting but can be severe in pregnant women.',

    'Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)': 'Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swollen veins in your lower rectum and anus. They can cause discomfort, itching, and bleeding. Hemorrhoids can be internal or external and are often caused by straining during bowel movements, obesity, or pregnancy.',
    'Heart attack': 'A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked for a long enough time that part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and other discomforts. It is a medical emergency.',
    'Varicose veins': 'Varicose veins are swollen, twisted veins that lie just under the skin and usually occur in the legs. They are often caused by weakened valves and veins in your legs, which can lead to pain and discomfort.',
    'Hypothyroidism': 'Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This leads to a slowed metabolism and can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and depression.',
    'Hyperthyroidism': 'Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. This leads to an accelerated metabolism and can cause symptoms such as weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness.',

    'Urinary tract infection': 'A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of your urinary system, including your kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra. It is more common in women and can cause symptoms such as a strong urge to urinate, a burning sensation when urinating, and cloudy urine.',
